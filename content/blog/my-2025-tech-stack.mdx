## The Evolution of My 2025 Tech Stack

Keeping up with the ever-changing JavaScript ecosystem feels like trying to drink from a firehose. After years of experimentation, I've finally settled on a tech stack that balances modernity with pragmatism – here's what's working for me in 2025.

### Frontend: Where Beauty Meets Performance

My current frontend arsenal combines the best of modern tooling with thoughtful design principles:

1. **ReactJS + TypeScript**  
   The foundation remains React with TypeScript for type safety. No surprises here – it's the bread and butter of modern web dev.

2. **Tailwind CSS v4 + ShadcnUI + HeroUI**  
   ```tsx
   // Example component using ShadcnUI and Tailwind
   import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
   
   export const HeroSection = () => (
     <div className="flex min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-blue-500">
       <Button variant="outline" className="mt-40">
         Get Started
       </Button>
     </div>
   );
   ```

3. **Design Philosophy**  
   I blend **Material Design v3**'s polished components (especially their motion system) with **neobrutalism** accents – think bold shadows and exaggerated borders for key elements.

4. **3D & Motion**  
   Three.js handles complex 3D visualizations while Framer Motion creates buttery-smooth page transitions.

### Backend: Supabase All The Things

After years of using NextAuth and Prisma, I've fully embraced **Supabase** for:

- **Authentication** (replaced NextAuth)
- **PostgreSQL Database** with row-level security
- **Stored Procedures** via PostgreSQL's RPC capabilities

```sql
-- Example Supabase RPC procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_posts(uid text)
RETURNS SETOF posts AS $$
  SELECT * FROM posts WHERE author_id = uid
$$ LANGUAGE SQL SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### The Supporting Cast

1. **Emails & Payments**  
   - **Resend** for transactional emails (bye-bye SendGrid)
   - **Stripe** for payments with new 2024 EU regulations compliance

2. **CMS**  
   **Payload CMS** remains my headless CMS of choice for content-heavy projects.

3. **Infrastructure**  
   - **Vercel** for frontend hosting and Serverless Functions
   - **Railway** for Python-based microservices
   - **AWS Learning** in progress (currently mastering EC2 and RDS)

### Why This Stack Works

1. **Supabase Flexibility**  
   The all-in-one solution reduced my AWS usage by 60% while maintaining scalability.

2. **Design Consistency**  
   Material Design v3 provides a solid foundation while neobrutalism accents add memorable flair.

3. **Performance**  
   Tailwind v4's new JIT compiler reduced CSS bundle size by 35% compared to v3.

### Future Plans

I'm currently diving into:
- **AWS Certifications** (Cloud Practitioner → Solutions Architect)
- **Supabase Edge Functions** for global low-latency APIs
- **WebGPU** integration with Three.js for next-level 3D rendering

## Final Thoughts

This stack isn't about chasing trends – it's about using battle-tested tools that play nicely together. While I still use some "old school" SQL alongside modern TypeScript, the key is maintaining a balance between innovation and maintainability.

As the great Alan Kay said: *"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."* Here's to building better web experiences in 2025 and beyond!
